# Visual Studio Code
## Keyboard Shortcuts for Windows

It has been said that *neccesity is the mother of invention*. The idea for the **VS Code Shortcuts for Windows** app was birthed from such a need. My only hope is eventually I'll be able to move around VS Code with the speed and efficiency of the development community.

## The App

**Visual Studio Code Shortcut for Window** is an app that with the click of a button will give you access to a library of keyboard shortcuts anyone can use to make their development experience more pleasurable and efficient.

## The Layout
**Visual Studio Code Shortcut for Window** consist of 8 buttons:
- Home
- General
- Basic Editing
- Search and Replace
- Multi-Cursor
- Add
- Modify
- Delete

*Home* - This is where the app starts. It contains all the buttons and a *search box*. The search box allows the user to search for the key sequence for a particular task. As the user types a dropdown box appears with a list of tasks matching what is being typed in the search box.  The user can then pick a task from the list to get the key sequence  for that task. 

The shortcuts are broken down in to four categories represented by the following buttons:

- General 
- Basic Editing
- Search and Replace
- Multi-Cursor

Clicking on the buttons will give you list of all the shortcuts from that particular category.

Along the bottom of the Home page are what we call *utility* buttons. These button allows the user to be modify the shortcuts.

*Add* - As the name suggest, Add allows the user to add shortcuts to any of the categories. When *Add* is clicked a box appears with an input box for *Task*, which is the command or task being performed, *Keys* which is the "*key sequence*" used to perform the task. There's a dropdown box with a list of the categories for the user to select from. Once the task and keys are entered and the category selected, the user hits submit and the app returns to the *Home* page where the user can then click the button for the category to see the shortcut added.

*Modify* - Modify allows a user to edit a shortcut. When a user clicks *Modify* *Pick a Category* appears with a dropdown menu that contains a list of categories, and a blank box. When the user selects a category the box populates with all the shortcuts from that category. Each shortcut will contain an edit button. When the user clicks the edit button a form pops up and is populated with the information for that shortcut. The user can then modify the information and submit the form. Once the form is submitted a new list appears with the updated shortcut. 

*Delete* - The Delete button gives the ability to delete a shortcut. When the *Delete* button is clicked just like with the Modify button, *Pick a Category* appears with a dropdown menu that contains a list of categories, and a blank box. When the user selects a category the box populates with all the shortcuts from that category. Each shortcut will contain a delete button. When the delete button is clicked the shortcut will disappear from the list.
